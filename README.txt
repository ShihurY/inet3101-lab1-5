# INET 3101 Lab 1.5

## Code for INET 3101 Lab 1.5

### mathheader.h
- An example of a header in C
- Contains two placeholder functions: addTwoInts and subtractTwoInts

### useofmathheader.c
- The backing C file that implements the functions
- addTwoInts: Returns the sum of two integers
- subtractTwoInts: Returns the difference of two integers

### math.c
- Main program needed to run the code
- It has predefined integers and prints the respective sums and differences.

### 3-dynamically-allocating.c
- Modified code that features dynamic memory allocation

### mallocofstructs.c
- Modified code that features memory allocation and "real world" structure

### inet3101-ShihurYang-lab15
- Word Document that contains screenshots of compiled/executed code as well as short paragraphs that answer the lab's questions.
